Copy-Move forgery has been widely studied as it is a really common forgery. 
Furthermore, it is the easiest forgery to create with serious security-related threats in particular for distant remote id 
onboarding where company ask their customer to send a photo of their ID document. 
It is then easy for a counterfeit to alter the information on the document by copying and pasting letters within the 
photo. 

On the other hand, copy-move detection algorithms are known to perform worse in presence of 
similar but genuine objects preventing from using them in practical situations like remote ID onboarding.
In this article we propose a novel copy-move public dataset containing forged ID documents and study 
current state-of-the-art performances on this dataset to evaluate their potential use in practical 
situations.
