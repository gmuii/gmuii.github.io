ABSTRACT="This paper presents a novel dataset for image and face manipulation
detection and localization called DEFACTO. The dataset was automatically
generated using Microsoft common object in context database (MSCOCO) to
produce semantically meaningful forgeries. Four categories of forgeries
have been generated. Splicing forgeries which consist of inserting an
external element into an image, copy-move forgeries where an element within
an image is duplicated, object removal forgeries where objects are removed
from images and lastly morphing where two images are warped and blended
together. Over 200000 images have been generated and each image is
accompanied by several annotations allowing precise localization of the
forgery and information about the tampering process."
